  - How many SMs  do we have, how much memory we have etc.
  - What is compute capability?
  - Query device properties

- [Memory](https://github.com/prav-nak/cuda/tree/main/3_memory_stuff)
- [Streams]()
  - Async operations, overlap compute with memory transfer
  - Streams can also be used to execute multiple kernels simultaneously to more fully take advantage of the device's multiprocessors
  - Timing kernels
